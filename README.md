# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my very first JavaScript program built completely from scratch, based on the Foundations Course from https://www.theodinproject.com

--------------------------------------
Created function ComputerSelection().

This function allows the script to randomly pick one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors).
I used math.floor to random select an integer of the three options 0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors.

For coding purposes I have included a alert function in the code so I can see what choices the rock is selecting and that it is actually selecting one of the three actual possibilities. This will be replaced with "return" as I move forward.
